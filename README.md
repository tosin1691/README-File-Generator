# README-File-Generator


## Description
This is a command line application that accepts user input and will enable a user to generate a README file for their project based on their response. JS, Node.JS and Inquirer library will be utilised to build this application.



## Programming

I used JS, Command line, Inquirer library and node.js to create a command line application for developers that: 

1) prompts users for information about their application repository and accept their input.
2) Based on their input a high quality, professional README.md file is generated that includes the following:
    * title
    Sections entitled
    * Description
    * Table of Contents
    * Installation
    * Usage
    * License
    * Contributing
    * Tests
    * Questions

3) Displays the following 
    * project title 
    * sections entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
    * list of options of license to choose from and a badge for that license is displayed near the top of the README file. 
    * A notice that explains which license the application is covered under in the section of the README entitled License
    * github username (once entered by user) in the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile
    * user's email (once inputted by user) in the section of the README entitled Questions, with instruction on how to reach them with additional questions
    * table of content that when links are clicked, readers are taken to the corresponding section of the README
    * The humidity

4) Added a gitignore file so that node_modules directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub.

5) added package.json with the required dependencies(inquirer 6.5.0)
